# Email Client App [Deployed Link](https://email-client-app-tau.vercel.app/)

## I created this app as part of a Rock8 coding round question here is the link to there website you can view it as well [here](https://www.roc8.careers/moonshot/tests)

### Talking about the app then this app is a working clone of a email application where the user can check and see for the new emails and also categories them as a favorite email it is pretty much similar to any other email application like **MS Outlook** or **G-Mail.**

#### Now Talking about the Application then I Created this Application Using the following tech stack:-

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; padding:20px">
    <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center;">
        <img src="./client/public/reactLogo.png" style="height:150px" />
        <a style="font-size:15px; font-weight:400" href="https://vite.dev/guide/"> React for UI </a>
    </div>
    <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center;">
        <img src="./client/public/tailwindLogo.png" style="height:150px" />
        <a style="font-size:15px; font-weight:400" href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite"> Tailwind for Styling </a>
    </div>
    <div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center;">
        <img src="./client/public/reduxLogo.png" style="height:150px" />
        <a style="font-size:15px; font-weight:400" href="https://react-redux.js.org/"> Redux for Global State Management and API Calls </a>
    </div>
</div>

#### To Run the App Locally in your machine 
````
- fork the repository, clone into you code editor.

cd client
npm i
npm run dev
````

**My Learnings:-** While Creating this app I was able to understand it better the working of a large scale application and how the organizations uses efficient approach to hide the complexity  of there application and make the application work seamlessly of there users.
